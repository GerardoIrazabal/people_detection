#People_detection
Real-time people detection with OpenCV and YOLOv4

This project uses OpenCV and the YOLOv4 model to detect people in a video in real time. The program processes each frame of the video, identifies the people present in it and draws rectangles around them to highlight their position.

Features:

-Real-time person detection using the pre-trained YOLOv4 model.
-Video processing with OpenCV to extract and analyze each frame.
-Drawing of rectangles around the detected people to highlight their position.
-Playback of the video with the detections in real time.

Requirements:

-Python 3.6 or higher
-OpenCV (full version)
-NumPy
-Imutils
-Instructions for use:

-Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed (OpenCV, NumPy and Imutils).
-Place the video you want to analyze in the same folder as the Python script or provide the full path to the file in the video_path variable.
-Run the Python script and observe how people are detected and highlighted in the video in real time.
